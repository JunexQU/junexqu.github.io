### **Objective:**
- Estimate the differences in ambient PM2.5 and O3 concentrations and in the mortality attributed to exposure to these pollutants

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- IAM
- Monte Carlo

### **Data Source**
- Model embeded

### **Findings:**

- Vehicular emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide have generally declined in China from 2005 tp 2015; NOx increased
- Without control measures, on-road vehicular emissions woudl have been 2-3 times as large as they actually were
