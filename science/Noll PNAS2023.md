## [Noll, Bessie, Bjarne Steffen, and Tobias S. Schmidt. The effects of local interventions on global technological change through spillovers A modeling framework and application to the road-freight sector. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 120.42 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215684120)

### **Objective:**
- Devise a framework and methodological approach to quantifying the effects of local demand-side interventions on global competition between incumbent and novel technologies

### **Case:**
- China, EU, US, India and Brazil

### **Methodology:**
- Simulation
  - Spillover impacts

### **Data Source**
- In code

### **Findings:**

- EV experiences growth in light- and medium-duty application segments absent intervention, reaching ~60% global market share of new vehicles sold by 2035

- EV growth can be further accelerated through policy intervention
- Spillover impacts occur if strong policies are introduced in large market
- Cooperative interventions in policy clubs can enhance spillover effects
- Free exchange of goods and knowledge plays important role
