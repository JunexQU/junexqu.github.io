## [Choma, Ernani F., et al. Health benefits of decreases in on-road transportation emissions in the United States from 2008 to 2017. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118.51 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107402118)

### **Objective:**
- Estimate the benefits of recent emissions reductions of on-road transportation in the contiguous US occuring between 2008 and 2017

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- Global exposure mortality model

### **Data Source**
- in Code

### **Findings:**

- 19800 deaths attributable to PM2.5 from transportation emissions in 2017, the figure is 2.4 times as high under 2008 EFs
- Regulation continues yield benefits: $270 billion in 2017 from reduced PM2.5 attributable mortality and GHG emissions
