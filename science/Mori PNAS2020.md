## [Mori, Tomoya, Tony E. Smith, and Wen-Tai Hsu. Common power laws for cities and spatial fractal structures. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117.12 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913014117)

### **Objective:**
- Develop explicit tests of the common power law using data of city size and road distances for various countries

### **Case:**
- US, France, Germany, Japan, China and India

### **Methodology:**
- Power law
- Least-squares prediction

### **Data Source**
- Population: LandScan
- Road network: OSM

### **Findings:**

- The spacing-out property and spatial CPL proporty is essentially all countries

- The existence of local city systems surrounding the largest cities and thus supports the spatial-grouping property
- City-size distributions in different parts of the hierarchical structure exhibit a high degree of commonality in terms of power laws
