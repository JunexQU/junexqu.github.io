## [Li, W., Schmidt, S., & Siedentop, S. (2024). Can polycentric urban development simultaneously achieve both economic growth and regional equity](https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X231191943)

### **Objective:**
- Examine whether or not polycentric development can result in greater economic growth and fewer regional inequalities

### **Case:**
- German urban regions; 2007 and 2017

### **Methodology:**
- Indicators
  - functional polycentric: $P_f (n) = (1-\sigma_f / \sigma_{max}) * \Delta$
  - Morphological polycentricity: rank-size distribution, $ln(rank) = \alpha + \beta ln(size)$
- Outcomes: 
  - Population-weighted Gini, Coefficient of variation and Gini
  - GDP
- Method:
  - OLS
  - 2SLS: historical degreee of polycentricity measured by municipality population and derivative of elevation

### **Data Source**
- Commuting flow

### **Findings:**

- A trend of increasing polycentricity from northeast to southwest

- Functional polycentricity can effectively reduce regional inequalities

- A larger population in 2007, higher proportion of educated workers and increased physical investment are positively associated with economic growth
- Functional polycentricity and Morphological polycentricity may not produce greater economic productivity

- Districts situated in more polycentric urban regions exhibit higher economic productivity than those in monocentric regions (borrowed size effect)
- Interaction term: increase in polycentricity in 2017 leads to economic growth in periphery but a loss for urban cores
