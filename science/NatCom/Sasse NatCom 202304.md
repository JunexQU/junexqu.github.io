## [Sasse, JP., Trutnevyte, E. A low-carbon electricity sector in Europe risks sustaining regional inequalities in benefits and vulnerabilities. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37946-3)

### **Objective:**
- Develop a framework for assessing regional benefits and vulnerabilities linked to a low-carbon transition of the EU electricity sectors

### **Case:**
- EU, Grid

### **Methodology:**
- EXPANSE
- Modelling to Generative Alternatives (MGA) for a set of alternative scenarios
- Benefit and vulnerability indicator

### **Data Source**
- Power plant
- Renewable, hydro power
- Capacity

### **Findings:**
- Regional benefits which include electricity investment and employment gains amongst others, are concentrated in rather affluent regions of northern EU
