## [Mengesha, I., Roy, D. Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56540-3)

### **Objective:**
- Present an agent-based model that integrates the energy sector, refined household behaviour rooted in both rational and bounded rationality as per behavioral economics literature, and nuanced firm and labour market dynamics

### **Case:**
- Global？

### **Methodology:**
- ABM: Keynes + Schumpeter family

### **Data Source**
- Carbon
- Energy
- Firm
- Household

### **Findings:**
- Emissions can be rapidly reduced while maintaining economic growth and decreasing inequality by combining carbon pricing with redistributive measures
