### **Objective:**
- Simulate and compare an extensive range of CMPs against all available SDG indicators to identify a cost-effective CMP for China via the iSDG-Climate-China model

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- IAM: iSDG

### **Data Source**
- SDG indicators in UN report

### **Findings:**
- When implementing mitigation policies without any other SDG interventions, China's overall SDG score would increase to 71.74-72.14 by 2030 and 77.08-79.61 by 2060 from 64.70 in 2022
