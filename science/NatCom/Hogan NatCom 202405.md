### **Objective:**
- Estimate non-linear relationships between temperature and corn or soybean yields, controlling for precipitation, state-specific quadratic time trends to capture all time-invariant confounding factors

### **Case:**
- US and Sub-Saharan Africa, grid

### **Methodology:**
- Regression

### **Data Source**
- ERA5-Land and GMFD
- Weather

### **Findings:**
- Harmful effects of temperature extremes when linked to US corn and soybean yields
