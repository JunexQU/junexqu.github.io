### **Objective:**
- Quantify the global and regional impacts of dietary changes on air quality and the related health impacts from air pollution

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- CAPRI: agricultural-economic model
- TM5-FASST
- GEM-E3

### **Data Source**
- Food available
- SSP

### **Findings:**
- Dietary changes towards lower consumption of animal source foods therefore substantially reduced agricultural emissions by 84-86% globally for the adoption of vegan diets, 69-70% for vegetarian diets and 44-48% for flexitarian diets
