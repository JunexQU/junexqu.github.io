### **Objective:**
- Identify power plants as stranded (oldest plants first in the baseline analysis) until the climate-compatible and operating capacity in the line

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Indicator

### **Data Source**
- Asset resolution
- Energy

### **Findings:**

- Prematurely decommissioned power plants are predominantly located in Asia-Pacific countries, Europe and the US and they mostly use coal as energy input

- The distribution of stranded assests  across asset owners varies strongly between countries

- Zooming in on the US, even if asset owners are equally exposed to strand assets, they can differ considerably in the timing of asset stranding due to differences in the age profile of power plant fleets
