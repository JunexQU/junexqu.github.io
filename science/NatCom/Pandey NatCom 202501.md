## [Pandey, B., Brelsford, C. & Seto, K.C. Rising infrastructure inequalities accompany urbanization and economic development. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56539-w)

### **Objective:**
- Study the structure and dynamics of urban infrastructure inequalities - to what extent are infrastructure ditributions preferentially allocated within and between regions of varying degrees of urbanization  

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Inequality indicator
- Cross section analysis
- Mann-Kendall trend (Spatial-temporal)
- ML

### **Data Source**
- Nightlight
- Population
- GDP

### **Findings:**
- Nighttime lights-derived infrastructure tends to concentrate in space
