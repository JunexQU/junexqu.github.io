### **Objective:**
- Gain new insight into the response of air quality to Nr emission changes driven by short-term compared to long-term policies and to understand how PM2.5 and N composition are changing under the influence of anthropogenic activities and climate change

### **Case:**
- US, households

### **Methodology:**
- LOESS regression
- LASSO ML
- OLS

### **Data Source**
- Household demographics: Data Axle
- EV infrastructure

### **Findings:**
- In both urban and rural areas, as household income increases, access to the public charging stations also increases
