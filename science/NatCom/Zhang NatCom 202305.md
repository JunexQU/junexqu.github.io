### **Objective:**
- Integrate the hydrothetical extraction method with a unified IO framework to estimate the carbon footprints of listed companies 

### **Case:**
- Chinese listed companies

### **Methodology:**
- Leontief matrix
- Hypothetical extraction model
- Decomposing analysis

### **Data Source**
- CEADs
- CSMAR

### **Findings:**
- Direct emissions from these companies account for 18.3% of national emissions from 2010 to 2019, and indirect emissions are over twice as large as the direct emissions
