### **Objective:**
- Analyze on a global scale the overall structural properties of more than 7000 bus routes, systematically comparing routes emerging in informal transport (mini)bus services with routes of centrally organized line services

### **Case:**
- Global cities

### **Methodology:**
- Efficiency indicator

### **Data Source**
- Bus GPS: OSM

### **Findings:**
- Most bus routs self-organize highly efficiently across regions and independently of the specific geographic or infrastructural features of the cities
