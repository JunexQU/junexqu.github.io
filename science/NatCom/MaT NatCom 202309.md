## [Ma, T., Zhang, S., Xiao, Y. et al. Costs and health benefits of the rural energy transition to carbon neutrality in China. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41707-7)

### **Objective:**
- Investigate how rural contemporary energy transition could contribute to China's carbon neutrality target and at what transformation costs

### **Case:**
- China's provinces

### **Methodology:**
- IAM: IMED, 

### **Data Source**
- Energy
- Emission

### **Findings:**
- Total energy consumption for rural cooking and heating (RCH) shows decreasing trends from 2014 to 2060
