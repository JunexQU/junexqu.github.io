### **Objective:**
- Apply a probabilistic approach to the quantification of future heat-related mortality risk

### **Case:**
- 47 Countries, cities

### **Methodology:**
- Quasi-Poisson regression
- Monte Carlo
- [CLIMADA](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python)

### **Data Source**
- Temperature data from model
- Mortality
- GDP

### **Findings:**
- Temperature-mortality association tend to be U-shaped, but still differ from city to city
