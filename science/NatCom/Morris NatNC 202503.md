### **Objective:**
- Take a probabilistic ensemble approach to representing a comprehensive set of both socio-economic and climate uncertainties in a complex human-earth system model to provide an updated set of probability distributions of both human and earth system outcomes that can help inform a risk-based decision-making process

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- IAM: EPPA and MESM

### **Data Source**
- Energy
- Economy
- Population
- Natural resource

### **Findings:**
- Earth system and socioeconomic uncertainties have a less than additive impact on the range of outcomes in terms of mean absolute deviation and other metrics of dispersion, as uncertainties can offset one another to varying degrees depending on the outcome of interest
