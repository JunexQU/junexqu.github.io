### **Objective:**
- Quantify the occupational extreme heat exposure among the labour force from 1995 to 2020

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Leontief
- Structural decomposition analysis

### **Data Source**
- MRIO: EORA, OECD
- labour force: ILO
- Heat: ERA5
- Working hours and income: Penn World Table
- Population: GPWv4

### **Findings:**
- The total heat exposure has surged by 60%, growing from 1142.3 billion person-hours in 1995 to 1826.2 billion person-hours in 2020
