## [Wang, B., Liu, Q., Ouyang, X. et al. Global hidden material flows triggered by China's vehicle supply chain far exceed eventual material use. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64090-x)

### **Objective:**
- Quantify hidden flows through total material requirement assessment

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- Simulation tool

### **Data Source**
- Global mine-site-based database

### **Findings:**

- 1163 Mt of total materials were extracted from the lithosphere for China's passenger car production in 2019, of which 57 Mt were directly extracted materials and triggered 1106 Mt of hidden flows
