### **Objective:**
- Generate a global urban greenspace dataset for 1028 large cities 

### **Case:**
- Global cities

### **Methodology:**
- Population-weighted exposure
- Gini

### **Data Source**
- Global urban boundaries
- Greenspace: Landsat
- WorldPop
- NDVI

### **Findings:**

- Global north cities show a prominently increasing trend in greenspace coverage, including EU, North American, Russia, Austrilia and a few cities of East Asia.
