### **Objective:**
- Analyze three future scenarios combining different climate, land use, and population conditions at the end of the 21st century for spatial population exposures to the four climate extremes at a 25-km resolution

### **Case:**
- Continentall US 

### **Methodology:**
- Simulation

### **Data Source**
- Weather Research and Forecasting 
- SSP
- Land use: CLUBS-SELECT
- CAPE

### **Findings:**

- Make population exposure to hot days 13.6 times the BOC level, cold days 1.1 times, heavy railfalls 7.5 times and STE 2.5 times

- Exposures in non-urban areas decrease and urbanization can increase an average individual's exposure to climate extremes

- Urban land effects can decrease as well as increase population exposures to climate extremes
