## [Li, Y., Svenning, JC., Zhou, W. et al. Green spaces provide substantial but unequal urban cooling globally. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51355-0)

### **Objective:**
- Assess the global inequalities in the cooling capability of existing urban green infrastructure across urban areas worldwide

### **Case:**
- 502 Global cities

### **Methodology:**
- Indicator
- Regression

### **Data Source**
- Population: UN
- Boundary: GAIA
- Water, NDVI, MODIS

### **Findings:**
- Existing green infrastructure of an average city has a capability of cooling down surface temperatures by ~3°C during warm seasons
