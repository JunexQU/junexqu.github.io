### **Objective:**
- Present a comprehensive analysis of capital development and quantifies temporal CO2 displacement along capital production, trade and use over the period of 1995-2017 

### **Case:**
- China, Province

### **Methodology:**
- MRIO simulation
- GRAS

### **Data Source**
- CEADs

### **Findings:**
- Temporally displaced CO2 emissions along capital's full lifespan take a large share in total emissiosn of China, and capital-intensive service sectors
