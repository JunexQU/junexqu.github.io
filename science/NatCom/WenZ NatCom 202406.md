### **Objective:**
- Gain new insight into the response of air quality to Nr emission changes driven by short-term compared to long-term policies and to understand how PM2.5 and N composition are changing under the influence of anthropogenic activities and climate change

### **Case:**
- China, grid

### **Methodology:**
- Random Forest
- ANOVA

### **Data Source**
- SO2
- NO2

### **Findings:**
- Short-term abatement measures during important international events substantially reduced PM2.5 concentrations, but air quality rebounded to pre-event levels after the measures ceased

- Long-term adherence to strict emission reduction policies led to successful decreases of 54% in PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing
