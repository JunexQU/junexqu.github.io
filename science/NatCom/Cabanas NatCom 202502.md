### **Objective:**
- Compare the performance at predicting mobility flows of simple gravity models, complex machine learning and deep-learning methods, and closed-form, interpretable models obtained through Bayesian symbolic regression

### **Case:**
- Six states, US

### **Methodology:**
- Flow prediction:
  - Bayesian machine scientist
  - Gravity model
  - Radiation model
  - Random forest
  - Deep gravity

### **Data Source**
- Mobile phone

### **Findings:**
- Automated equation discovery approaches lead to parsimonious closed-form models that combine the most desirable aspects
