### **Objective:**
- Analyze the long-term blue carbon sustainable development level of global coastal countries and adopt a global cooperation model to collectively cope with global climate change challenges and enhance the synergies between blue carbon and society

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Indicator
- PCA
- Linear mixed regression

### **Data Source**
- Global carbon atlas
- Climate change risk
- GDP
- Marine protected area
- International carbon action partnership

### **Findings:**
- An upward trend in BCDI, driven by the combined effects of three subsystems with development capacity exerting the most significant influence
