### **Objective:**
- If atmosphere-ocean fluxes of carbon and heat are proportional to each other, does this imply a constant ratio of warming to cumulative emissions?

### **Case:**
- Global

### **Methodology:**
- CMIP6
- ESM

### **Data Source**
- Atmosphere

### **Findings:**

- Atmosphere-ocean fluxes of heat and carbon evolve very differently to each other in abrupt CO2 increase experients

- Changes in the atmosphere, ocean and land carbon pools all contribute to making warming proportional to cumulative emissions
