### **Objective:**
- Conduct a data-driven, techno-econometric analysis that incorporates elemenets of top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches to quantitatively rank countries and territories in en energy-water-food (EWF) nexus plus governance-based biojet fuel sustainability index

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Feedback model: life-cycle assessment

### **Data Source**
- Energy
- Emission

### **Findings:**

- The country emerged in the top quartile for the energy, food and governnace domains, while still having above-average water security

- EU countries dominate the sustainability ranking with 13 countries in the top 30, with the general characteristics of having secured food supplies and functioning governments, while being merely above average in water security but having low scores in energy security
