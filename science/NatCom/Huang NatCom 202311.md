### **Objective:**
- Provide a consistent analysis of urban heat island (UHI) impact on mortality risk for 85 cities across EU and consider the impact of both heat and cold temperatures over the entire annual cycle

### **Case:**
- EU cities

### **Methodology:**
- Monte Carlo simulation

### **Data Source**
- Heat: UrbClim
- Elevation map: MERIT DEM
- Population: SEDAC
- Mortality: Mosselot

### **Findings:**

- Mortality risk generally increases towards the extreme ends of each city's typical temperature range, with greater risks to older age groups

- The largest change in mortality risk per unit change of land imperviousness around the urban-rural boundary, from rural conditions of minimal imperviousness to urban environments with slightly built-up areas
