### **Objective:**
- Use the TEMPO system model to simulate the possible evolution of emissions from passenger and freight mobility in the US 

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- TEMPO model

### **Data Source**
- Emissions
- Mode choice

### **Findings:**

- Emissions in 2050 are reduced by 24% relative to 2019
