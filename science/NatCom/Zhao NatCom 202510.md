## [Zhao, P., Li, Y., Zhang, C. et al. Arctic Sea Route access reshapes global shipping carbon emissions. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64437-4)

### **Objective:**
- Quantify the long-term carbon consequences of Arctic Sea Route (ASR) access using a trade-integrated shipping emissions projection (TISEP) model

### **Case:**
- Nanjing, China

### **Methodology:**
- ARIMAX model for trade volume
- Trip distribution
- Emission model

### **Data Source**
- Trade related
- Shipping route

### **Findings:**

- ASR use will increase global shipping emissions by 8.2% by 2100, with Arctic emissions rising from 0.22-2.72%

- Environmental disparity in exposure to emissions will increase since North-east Asia, Northern EU, and North America will experience particularly large increases in emissions due to rerouted shipping flows
