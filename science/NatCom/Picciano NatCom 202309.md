### **Objective:**
- Examine the underlying fundamental question of whether and to what extent national CO2 policy with an ambition level comparable to near-term federal goals can mitigate racial/ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- Economy-wide, energy-economy modelling tool (USREP-ReEDS)

### **Data Source**
- CO2
- PM2.5, NH3, VOC

### **Findings:**
- CO2 emission reductions relative to baseline in 2030 are driven mostly by the electricity sector, followed by transportation, industry, and residential and commercial sector.

- Air pollution exposure decreases for all racial/ethnic groups in the primary policy cases

- It doesn't reduce exposure disparities at the national level

- A considerable amount of heterogeneity at the state and urban area level
