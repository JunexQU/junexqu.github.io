## [P. Shorey,& A. Abdulla,  Integrating climate and physical constraints into assessments of net capture from direct air capture facilities, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2410824121)

### **Objective:**
- Present results from an integrated assessment of the global deployment potential of a leading liquid-solvent direct air capture (DAC) technology

### **Case:**
- Global grid

### **Methodology:**
- Processed simulation model

### **Data Source**
- Climate
- Energy

### **Findings:**

- Capture rates are strongly driven by temperature and, to a lesser extent, pressure
