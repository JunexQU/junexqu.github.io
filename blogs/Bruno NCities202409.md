## [Bruno, M., Monteiro Melo, H.P., Campanelli, B. et al. A universal framework for inclusive 15-minute cities. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00119-4)

### **Objective:**
- Merge theoretical accessibility designs with the quest for the 15-minute city to understand how optimally placed amenities can improve local accessibility

### **Case:**
- Core cities

### **Methodology:**
- Accessibility index to services
- Inequality: Gini

### **Data Source**
- City boundary: GHSL
- POI: OSM
- Population: worldpop
- Time: OSRM

### **Findings:**

- Accessibility is not a currency equally distributed in the population, with a centric structure of cities or polycentric one in some notable cases (i.e. Barcelona and Paris)

- Cities with bad average accessibility are also more unequal; city centers have better access to services than peripheral areas

- 15-minute city paradigm is suitable for relatively compact city
