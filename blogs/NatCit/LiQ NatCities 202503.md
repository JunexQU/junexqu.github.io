## [Li, Q., Du, D. & Yu, Y. Scaling and network evolution of technology transfer in US cities. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-025-00209-x)

### **Objective:**
- Explore the network evolution of technology transfer from three angles: nationwide space-filling, hierarchical structuring reflecting intercity relationships and intracity network polycentricity, linking these to the growth of urban scaling laws

### **Case:**
- US cities

### **Methodology:**
- Scaling law and residuals
- Block modelling (network): Cluster and dissimilarity analysis
- Ht index
- Polycentric index

### **Data Source**
- Population
- Patents

### **Findings:**

- Both local and non-local technology transfers have experienced periodic rapid growth and intracity transfers are far more concfentrated than intercity transfers are

- The geographic network of technology transfer strongly alighns with the city clusters of the US

- Superlinear urban scaling law likely arises from the structure of urban networks

- The hierarchical evolution of cities involves both path dependence and path creation
