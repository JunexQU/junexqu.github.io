## [Wang, D., Chen, S. Synergistic action on mitigation and adaptation pilot policies to enhance low-carbon resilience of Chinese cities. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-025-00303-0)

### **Objective:**
- Do dual-pilot cities outperform single pilot cities in terms of carbon reduction and cliamte resilience enhancement?
- How can the policy effectiveness of dual-pilot cities be quantitatively assessed?

### **Case:**
- Chinese cities

### **Methodology:**
- DID
- Double machine learning

### **Data Source**
- Statistics

### **Findings:**

- Dual-pilot policy significantly enhances the low-carbon resilience of Chinese cities
