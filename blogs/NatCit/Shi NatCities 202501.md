### **Objective:**
- Analyse the spatiotemporal evolution of China's urban housing utilization efficiency (HUE) between 2010 and 2020

### **Case:**
- China's cities and subdistricts

### **Methodology:**
- Indicator

### **Data Source**
- Population census
- Housing: Anjuke

### **Findings:**

- HUEs decreased from 2010 to 2020

- Cities in higher tiers exhibited higher HUEs, which a decrease as the tier lowered
