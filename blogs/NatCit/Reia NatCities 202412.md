## [Reia, S.M., Rao, P.S.C., Barthelemy, M. et al. Domestic migration and city rank dynamics. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00170-1)

### **Objective:**
- Capture the turbulent dynamics at the population-based rank level associated with the rise and fall of cities

### **Case:**
- USA, UK, Canada, France

### **Methodology:**
- Scaling law
- Population growth equation

### **Data Source**
- migration flow and population

### **Findings:**

- A limited number of small cities experience domestic migration shocks

- USA, UK and Canada: Flows from large and nearby cities to small cities are the main source of migration shocks; in these cities, large cities are losing population, while small cities are gaining population

- In France, large cities gain population as a result of inflows from small cities
