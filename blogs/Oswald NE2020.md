## [Oswald, Y., Owen, A. & Steinberger, J.K. Large inequality in international and intranational energy footprints between income groups and across consumption categories. Nat Energy 5, 231–239 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-0579-8)

### **Objective:**
- Build an energy and expenditure extended input-output model that distinguishes between income groups of households

### **Case:**
- 86 countries

### **Methodology:**
- Power law
- Leontief matrix and energy consumption for households
- Inequality: Lorenz and Gini

### **Data Source**

- GTAP 9
- Global consumption data: World Bank (BRICS states), Eurostat household budget surveys
- Final energy consumption: IEA
- International standard Industrial classification of economic activities revision
- Income per capita growth: OECD (Future)

### **Findings:**

- Energy footprint scale sublinearly with expenditure
- Expenditure at higher levels becomes slightly less energy intense

- Energy footprints vary more widely in their inequality than expenditure does
- The pattern is even more pronounced when comparing income inequality and energy inequality

- Top 10% consume ~39% of total final energy
- In land transport, the bottom 50% receive a bit more than 10% of the energy used and in air transport they make use of less than 5%
- The top 10% use ~45% of the energy for land transport and around 75% for air transport
