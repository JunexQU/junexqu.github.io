### **Objective:**
- What is the climate change mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options?
- What are the implications for well-being of these demand-side mitigation options

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Demand-side mitigation options: workshops

### **Data Source**
