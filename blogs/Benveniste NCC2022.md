## [Benveniste, H., Oppenheimer, M. & Fleurbaey, M. Climate change increases resource-constrained international immobility. Nat. Clim. Chang. 12, 634–641 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01401-w)

### **Objective:**
- Provide a quantitative, global analysis of international immobility due to resource deprivation caused by climate change

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- Population flow: 
  - gravity mode: OLS
  - Robustness: second dataset, reverse causality, shared border
- IAM

### **Data Source**

- Migrant: OECD and World Bank
- Future projection: SSP
- Income and education: OECD

### **Findings:**

- Migrants tend to end up in lower income quintiles when the destination is a developed region and in higher income quintiles when the destination is a developing region
- Most migrants tend to come from richer income levels at origin

- Poorest populations experience higher damages from climate change
- Resources loss through damages are no longer compensated by gains from remittances

- The resources that are available or not to migrate dominate the pull to move towards richer regions
- In most places, resources decrease with climate change for the poorest populations
- Marginal effect of emissions on social welfare (social cost of carbon) are strongly depends on income elascticity of damages
