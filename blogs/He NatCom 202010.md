### **Objective:**
- Evaluate the Dual Credit policy for reducing GHG emissions in transport sector in China

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- IAM: NEOCC and China Vehilce Fleet model

### **Data Source**
- Energy and emission

- Total GHG emissions of the Chinese passenger vehicle will not peak until 2032; but the GHG peak would be brought to 2028 if  the GHG emissions of electricity used by BEVs are properly accounted for in the Dual Credit policy
