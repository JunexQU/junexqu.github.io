### **Objective:**
- Adopt the lens of evolutionary population dynamics to show the emergence and meaning of Zipf' distribution as a neutral law, signaling the absence of selection

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- Population growth equation

### **Data Source**
- Mobility and migration data

### **Findings:**

- The structure of migration flows between cities, together with the differential magnitude of their vital rates, determinea variety of city size distributions using Zipf law.
