## [Behrer, A.P., Heft-Neal, S. Higher air pollution in wealthy districts of most low- and middle-income countries. Nat Sustain 7, 203–212 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01254-x)

### **Objective:**
- Country-level estimates for the within-country correlation between wealth and pollution

### **Case:**
- Country, Global

### **Methodology:**
- OLS with fixed effects

### **Data Source: Open**
- Relative wealth in 103 countries: 2.4 km *2.4 km
- Global pollution: 
  - van Donkelaar research group
  - EDGAR: sectoral pollution
- Global elevation: National Aeronautics and Space Administration Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer project
- Urbanization: URCA, Nature (2018)
- Economic concentration: GHSL, built volume (100m)
- Country income: World Bank

    
### **Findings:**

- Low and middle-income countries tend to have lower pollution
- Positive correlation between health and ambient pollution within-country

- The highest pollution levels with the highest wealth levels are the most urban
- In cities where the wealthy tend to live at higher elevations, they also tend to live in areas of lower pollution and vice versa
