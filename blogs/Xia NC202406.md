## [Xia, C., Zheng, H., Meng, J. et al. Outsourced carbon mitigation efforts of Chinese cities from 2012 to 2017. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00088-8)

### **Objective:**
- Investigate outsourced carbon mitigation efforts at city level by comparing carbon mitigation contributions of both local and outsourced efforts in supply chains

### **Case:**
- Cities, China

### **Methodology:**
- Leontief
- Structural decomposition

### **Data Source**

- CEADs: City MRIO
- CO2 emissions: Shan

### **Findings:**

- The increase concentrated in a few super emitters, where are the centers of population and economic activity

- The increase is highly concentrated in service sector, while others decreas.

- Outsourced emissions rising from 78.6% in 2012 to 81.9% in 2017.

- Decrease in carbon intensity drove emissions down; improved production structure led to lower emissions; and the increase in final demand led to an increase in emissions

- The contribution of carbon intensity change in upstream cities was greater than the local mitigation.
