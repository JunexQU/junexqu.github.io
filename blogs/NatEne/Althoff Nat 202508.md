### **Objective:**
- Disentangle the influences of the built environment from personal activities through a natural experiment, and quantify the impact of walkability on changes in physical activity levels at the individual and population scale

### **Case:**
- US individuals

### **Methodology:**
- Walkability

### **Data Source**
- Azumio Argus smartphone
- BE

### **Findings:**

- Relocations to more walkable cities are associated with increases of about 1,100 daily steps, equivalent to 11 minutes more walking activity
