### **Objective:**
- Use a randomized control trial to examine the causal effect of a hybrid schedule in which employees are allowed to WFH two days per week
- Focus on university-graduate employees in software engineering, marketing, accounting and finance, whose activities are mainly creative team tasks

### **Case:**
- Shanghai, China

### **Methodology:**
- Equivalence test
- Treatment regression

### **Data Source**

- Survey: Trip.com
- Travel time: Weiss et al. (2018)
- Boundary: GADM

### **Findings:**

- Hybrid WFH contributes to one-third reduction in attrition rate and improves satisfaction score

- Managers tend to had more negative views, reporting that hybrid WFH would be likely to affect productivity by -2.6%, whereas non-managers had more positive views (+0.7%)
- After the experiment, the views of managers increased to 1.0%, converging towards non-manager's views
