## [Kolcava, D., Smith, E.K. & Bernauer, T. Cross-national public acceptance of sustainable global supply chain policy instruments. Nat Sustain 6, 69–80 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-022-00984-8)

### **Objective:**
- How to make sense of the widespread, unlateral policy shifts towards stronger sustainability transparency regulations of global supply chains with industrialized economies

### **Case:**
- 12 global countries

### **Methodology:**
- OLS

### **Data Source: partial open**
- [Survey](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/URL6A4)

### **Findings:**

- Most respondents agree that governments should adopt new laws to make information disclosure on environmental and working conditions mandatory
- Citizens prefer policies that apply to companies of most sizes, having a slight preference for policies applying to large and very large companies
- Policies that aim to strongly increase transparency obtain strong support
- Respondents prefer robust government enforcement competencies in cases of non-compliance
