## [Emmerling, J., Andreoni, P., Charalampidis, I. et al. A multi-model assessment of inequality and climate change. Nat. Clim. Chang](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02151-7)
### **Objective:**
- Investigate the link between climate change and inequality, quantifying the distributional implications of climate policies and climate change impacts

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- 8 IAMs
- Scenario protocol developed by IPCC

### **Data Source**
- IAMs Data
- carbon

### **Findings:**

- Without climate impacts, a continuation of secular trends of persisting within-country inequality can be obtained

- Climate impacts are expeceted to increase the Gini index by about 1.4 points by 2100

- The combined effect of climate impacts, climate policy, and redistribution becomes inequality decreasing
- GDP losses reach on average 4.9% by the end of the century
