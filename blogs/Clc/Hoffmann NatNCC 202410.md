## [Hoffmann, R., Abel, G., Malpede, M. et al. Drought and aridity influence internal migration worldwide. Nat. Clim. Chang](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02165-1)

### **Objective:**
- Examine the impact of drought and aridity on global internal migration flow using a census-based migration datasets

### **Case:**
- 72 Countries

### **Methodology:**
- international flow
- migration rate
- Indicator: 
  - dryness: PET and PDSI
  - water balance: SPEI
- Standardized
- Gravity-type fixed effects model
- Poisson-pseudo maximum likelihood
- Interaction
- Prediction
- Robustness
  - Spatial interdependencies
  - Multilateral resistance
  - Second migrant data
  - 10 year
  - log-linear
  - population-weighting
  - varying time window
  - varing fixed effects
  - varing the standardization
  - investigation the effects before census

### **Data Source**
- IPUMSD international database
- Climate research unit
- Drought: SPEI
- GDP

### **Findings:**

- High- and low-mobility clusters which are shaped by country-specific topographic and socio-economic characteristics

- Central China experiences higher out-migration, similarly in central US, Canada, Brazil, whereas lower levels of out-migration and higher immigration are observed in eastern coastal regions

- Most internal migration is over short distance and between neighbouring regions

- Considerably higher migration to urban  as opposed to rural areas

- Significant and sizeable effects of drought and aridity on migration; differential impacts over time; non-linear migration impacts with increasing environmental stree

- Impacts are moderated by socioeconomic factors
