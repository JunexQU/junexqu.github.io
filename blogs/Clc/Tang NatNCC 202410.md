### **Objective:**
- Investiagte age-based household carbon footprints in China and its provinces by compiling a global MRIO table

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- international flow
- migration rate
- MRIO

### **Data Source**
- CFPS
- CEADs

### **Findings:**

- East provinces tend to have higher total carbon footprints

- China's per capita carbon footprint is much lower than that of developed countries

- Carbon footprint is inversely correlate with age: young people have relatively higher household carbon footprint than those of midlle and older people

- Two top consumptions: related to residence and transport
- Fertility in combination with retirement delay tend to further increase the carbon footprint in China
