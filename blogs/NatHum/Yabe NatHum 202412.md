## [Yabe, T., García Bulle Bueno, B., Frank, M.R. et al. Behaviour-based dependency networks between places shape urban economic resilience. Nat Hum Behav](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-02072-7)

### **Objective:**
- Investigate the interdependencies between urban business and amenities using human mobility data and presents a quantitative framework to measuring economic resilience to large-scale behavioural changes

### **Case:**
- 5 Metropolitans in the US

### **Methodology:**
- OLS

### **Data Source**
- Mobile phone data
- POIs

### **Findings:**

- The dependent relationships that exist between business and places are highly complex products of human behavioural preferences and decisions rather than a measure determined solely by the urban form

- Urban economic networks are determined by the behaviour generated by individual activity patterns, connecting distant businesses and amenities due to the combination of work, leisure and shopping activities on the same day
