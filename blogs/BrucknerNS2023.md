## [Bruckner, B., Shan, Y., Prell, C. et al. Ecologically unequal exchanges driven by EU consumption. Nat Sustain 6, 587–598 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-022-01055-8)

### **Objective:**
- Few studies look at the geographical distribution of these environmental pressures and impacts

### **Case:**
- California

### **Methodology:**
- MRIO approach
- Environmental indicators


### **Data Source: partial open**
- Extended multiregional input-output table: EXIOBASE
- GDP: World Bank
- World Economic Outlook
- Population: United Nations

### **Findings:**

- 66-77% of GHG emissions happened within the EU, while the remaining 23-24% happened outside its borders
- land use and biodiversity loss from land use show roughly a 50-50 split with shares increasing in the EU

- Various impacts across countries and sectors
- Consumption of food was the highest contributor to land use and biodiversity loss

- Five envrionmental pressures decreased but other five increased
- EU consumption is connected to high GHG emissions in Russia and countries in the ROW Asia and Pacific region

- EV ratios associated with EU consumption are more beneficial for most member countries than for non-EU countries and regions
- EU consumption induced higher environmental pressures and impacts per value added in the ROW Europe region than others
