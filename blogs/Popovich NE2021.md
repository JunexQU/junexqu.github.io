### **Objective:**
- Examine the case for zero-emission, battery-electric propulsion in the US freight rail sector on the basis of current and forecasted energy storage technologies combined with access to renewable energy at industrial rates

### **Case:**
- California

### **Methodology:**
- Simulation

### **Data Source**

- [Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00915-5#Sec14)

### **Findings:**

- Energy consumed by battery freight trains increases by 5% 
- Battery price and access wholesale electricity tariffs - retrofitting diesel-electric locomotives with battery-electric techonology could save the US freight rail sector billions of dollars while yielding environmental, health, and grid-resilience benefits
