## [Luo, Z., Lv, Z., Zhao, J. et al. Shipping-related pollution decreased but mortality increased in Chinese port cities. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00050-8)

### **Objective:**
- Evaluate shipping-related PM2.5 pollution and mortalities attributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure across Chinese port cities from 2016 to 2020.

### **Case:**
- Port cities

### **Methodology:**
- Brute Force method: mortality
- Change decomposition: Pilling-up decomposition approach

### **Data Source**
- AIS data and Shipping emission inventory model
- Weather research and forecasting (WRF) and community multiscale air quality (CMAQ)
- Population: worldpop
- Time: OSRM

### **Findings:**

- Port cities are currently the primary destinations for population migrantion in China
