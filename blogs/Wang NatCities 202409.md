## [Wang, L., Saiz, A. & Li, W. Natural fragmentation increases urban density but impedes transportation and city growth worldwide. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00118-5)

### **Objective:**
- There is still relatively scarce research providing holistic, global and comparative understanding of the role of natural barries on urban outcomes

### **Case:**
- Port cities

### **Methodology:**
- Share of barries index
- Average nonconvexity index
- Detour index
- Robustness
  - change radius
  - data triming

### **Data Source**
- People-based
  - Global human settlement urban centres database: GHS-UCDB
- Building-based
  - Spatial expansion of 200 cities: AUE
  - Urban areas: GHUB
  - Multitemporal global urban boundary: GUB
- Water bodies: Water Body Multitemporal
- Slopes: NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM)

### **Findings:**

- Cities with a high share of barriers are predominantly situated in Central, East and Southeast Asia, and Southern Europe

- Most cities impacted by geographical barriers lay near the ocean

- Geographical constraints have an impact on road distances between points; however, barriers that generate nonconvexities display strong effects
- Dry places with no rivers and low precipitation tend to feature shorter-distance road trips
- Road distance tends to be lower in high-income countries

- A move across the 50th-90th percentile in barriers is associated with 14.5% higher urban densities, it's also related with a reduced built-up imprint as a percentage of the urban area
- Geographical fragmentation in and around cities to be associated with lower GDP per capita
- Topographical land fragmentation is associated with reduced urban night lights
