## [Xia, Y., Liao, C., Chen, X. et al. Future reductions of China’s transport emissions impacted by changing driving behaviour. Nat Sustain 6, 1228–1236 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01173-x)

### **Objective:**
- Decompose and understand how driving behavior affects vehicular emissions and how trends in behavior may or may not contribute to the net-zero emission reduction goal

### **Case:**
- Hefei, Nanjing, China

### **Methodology:**
- Laval-leclercq model (Trait modeling)


### **Data Source: partial open**
- Car ownership: provincial yearbook
- Vehicle emission standards: China mobile source environmental management annual report
- Trajectory data: request
- Nanjing trajectory 2018: [UTE project](http://seutraffic.com/)
- Trajectory 2021: [TJRD TS Project](https://tjrdts.com/)

### **Findings:**

- Despite the fast-decreasing trends in other major pollutants, CO2 emissions are shown to decrease slightly

- Accumulated extra emissions from 2013 to 2050 can reach 400.5 tons CO2, 1.5 million tons CO, 69.1 thousand tons NOx, 22.4 thousand tons HC and 3.3 thousand tons PM
- Yearly peak of major pollutant emissions would appear in 2025 or 2026

- Imposing the carbon price lowers fossil fuel combustion and increases renewable and bioenergy uses across all world regions
- Regional socio-demographic characteristics affect population vulnerability, influencing health outcomes

- The deforestation method is a key assumption driving the OC emissions increases
