### **Objective:**
- Investigate long-term sustainability outcomes for two of the largest HUD-administered block grants, the community development block grant, entitlement programme and the Home investment partnerships programme 

### **Case:**
- Albany

### **Methodology:**
- The loss of economic output (OW-ESRI):
  - $OW-ESRI_j = \sum_i \frac{s_i^{out}}{\sum_l s_l^{out}}[1-h_i(T)]$
- Remove firms

### **Data Source**

- [Human and machine-readable format to Database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SF1DRW)
- [Albany Open Data GeoHub](https://geohub.albanyga.gov/)

### **Findings:**

- Summarize IAM model
- For the firm joined ETS, most of them cluster around low emissions and low economic relevance

- The ratio of median electricity charges to median income is 8-12%, higher than the national threshold
- Housing policies can accelerate participation in energy efficiency among capital-constrained homeowners or renters
- HUD funded housing projects in Albany generated monthly energy savings of 5-11% for participating households 
- HUD funded block grants in Albany reduced electricity use by 4.72 million kWh
