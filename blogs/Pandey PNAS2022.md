## [Pandey B, Brelsford C, Seto K C. Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization[J]. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2119890119)

### **Objective:**
- Apply an inequality lens to infrastructure,conceptualizing infrastructure as an urbanization dimension, to understand the spatial structure and characteristics of attendant unequal outcomes and more broadly, urban inequalities

### **Case:**
- Emerging economies: India and South Africa

### **Methodology:**
- Infrastructure inequality index
- OLS, PCA

### **Data Source**

- Census
- Satellite data: VIIRS

### **Findings:**

- Urbanization in India and South Africa is characterized by greater urban inequalities than rural inequalities
- Infrastructure inequality is more comparable than income inequality
