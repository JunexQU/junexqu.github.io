### **Objective:**
- Calculate the local network impacts associated with low-carbon technology deployment across over 40000 local areas in GB using geographically disaggregated data to inform local characteristics of each of them

### **Case:**
- England and Wales in Scotland

### **Methodology:**
- Weighted polynomial regression
- Neural network

### **Data Source**
- UKLCTD LSOA-level data

### **Findings:**

- Estimates of excess local network upgrade costs vary substantially between local areas of each rurality, but are typically higher in urban areas, owing to longer feeders serving larger numbers of meters

- Differences in local network characteristics are more important in determining network upgrades costs than level of technology deployment

- A targeted approach to flexibility deployment enabled by the use of geographically disaggregated data could lead to substantial reductions in network upgrade cost
