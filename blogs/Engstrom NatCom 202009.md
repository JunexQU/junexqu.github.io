## [Engström, G., Gars, J., Krishnamurthy, C. et al. Carbon pricing and planetary boundaries. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18342-7)

### **Objective:**
- Assess the environmental consequences of a global carbon pricing policy in a multi-boundary world

### **Case:**
- Global

### **Methodology:**
- IAM

### **Data Source**
- GTAP

### **Findings:**

- A higher global carbon price may be sufficient to single-handedly reduce almost all planetary pressures

- A complementary policy of scaling back biofuel subsidies as the carbon price is increased would help avoid negative impacts
