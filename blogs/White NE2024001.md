## [White, L.V., Riley, B., Wilson, S. et al. Geographies of regulatory disparity underlying Australia’s energy transition. Nat Energy 9, 92–105 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-023-01422-5)

### **Objective:**
- Understand the spatial and socio-demographic characteristics of communities facing non-recognition in protections afforded by present day electricity retail regulations

### **Case:**
- Australian

### **Methodology:**
- Logistic regression
  - VIF: 0-2

### **[Data Source](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_i_Electricity_retail_regulation_in_Australian_settlements_focusing_on_residential_consumer_protections_and_providing_sociodemographic_and_remoteness_indicators_i_/24550585)**

- Australian Bureau of Statistics:
  - Residential population and demographics
- Regulatory documents

### **Findings:**

- Remote settlements and indigenous settlements are more likely to be underserved on multiple metrics
- All settlements that are urban or regional have legally enforceable protections for all customers regarding life support, guaranteed service and disconnection reporting

- Higher IRSAD score (indicating a relative lack of disadvantage and greater advantage in general) are correlated with higher likelihood of  having life-support protections, guaranteed service levels, disconnec- tion reporting requirements and clear complaints processes.
- Remote communities are less likely to have comprehensive regulatory protections for access to electricity and the services it provides
