### **Objective:**
- How the environmental footprints of consumption and responsibilities for planetary boundaries transgression are distributed across different expenditure (income) groups globally

### **Case:**
- Global country

### **Methodology:**
- EE-MRIO
- Downscale
- Gini index

### **Data Source**
- MRIO: GTAP11
- Household expenditure: 
  - World bank global consumption database
  - Eurostat household budget survey
  - Japanese family income and expenditure survey
  - Canada survey of household spending
  - Austrailia household expenditure survey

### **Findings:**

- The world's wealthiest 10% of consumers was responsible for 43% of carbon emissions, 23% of HANPP, 26.1% of nitrogen fixation, 24.7% of phosphorus fertilizer, 18.5% of blue-water and 37.2% MSA loss

- The poorest 10% contributed marginally 5.4% to HANPP, 4.4% blue-water consumption and less than 3% to the other footprints
- On a per capita basis, the environmental impacts of the top 10% were 4.2 to 77 times that of the bottom 10%
