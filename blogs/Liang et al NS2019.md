## [Liang, X., Zhang, S., Wu, Y. et al. Air quality and health benefits from fleet electrification in China. Nat Sustain 2, 962–971 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0398-8)

### **Objective:**
- It is more important to evaluate the air quality impacts of fleet electrification in the country with the largest EV market

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- Weather research and forecasting model
- Community multiscale air quality model
- Health indicator

### **Data Source**
- Upon request

### **Findings:**

- Electrification will substantially reduce emissions from on-road vehicles, while the increase in power plants will be small

- Fleet electrification will slightly increase the total emissions of primary PM2.5 nationwide but lead to emission reductions in three developed regions

</center>

- Greater PM2.5 abatements within the urban areas than in rural areas
- The highest NO2 reductions will occur in the most populous core cities
- Three developed region account for approximately 37% of the total number avoided premature deaths
