## [Du, J., Liu, Y., Xu, Z. et al. Global effects of progress towards Sustainable Development Goals on subjective well-being. Nat Sustain 7, 360–367 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01270-5)

### **Objective:**
- Explore how different factors affect SWB along the global sustainable development gradient

### **Case:**
- China counties

### **Methodology:**
- SWB: World Happliness Reports
- SDG evenness: Mean SDG index score (MIS) gradient
  - Radar chart method: $Even = S_i / (\pi (\frac{L_i}{2\pi}^2))*100$
  - $S_i = \sum_j S_j = \sum_j \pi f_j r_j^2$
  - $L_i = \sum_j L_j = 2 \|r_{max}-r_{min} \| + \sum_j 2\pi f_j r_j$
- Moving window method
- Linear, polynomial (quadratic and cubic) and logrithmic regression 
  - the lowest AIC

### **[Data Source: Open](https://zenodo.org/records/10433250)**
- SDG index score: sustainable development report
- SWB: world happiness report
- GDP: IMF

### **Findings:**

- SWB evenness is relatively laggard dimension in fulfilling the SDGs
- SDG evenness and per capita GDP are positively related with global SW

- SDG evenness showed positive relationship with SWB only in countries with low MIS
- Per capita GDP is higher in countries with high MIS

- Per capita GDP exhibited an increasing positive partial correlation with SWB, from weak to strong along with increasing MIS
