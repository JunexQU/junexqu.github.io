### **Objective:**
- Gather year-long real world monitoring records from more than 60,000ETs and compare the usage patterns from DT and ET datasets

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- Life-cycle simulation

### **Data Source**
- CO2 emissions
- Trunk GPS

### **Findings:**

- ET usage had significantly lower intensity compared with DTs
