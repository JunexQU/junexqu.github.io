## Wu, H., Levinson, D. & Sarkar, S. How transit scaling shapes cities. Nat Sustain 2, 1142–1148 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0427-7
1. **Objective:**
    - Understanding the relationships between urban public transport structure and residential density, governed by a scaling relationship with transport accessibility to jobs
    - Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)
    - The more transit services available, the higher the density of the population
2. **Case:**
    - US census blocks
    - 48 major metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
3. **Methodology:**
    - First: $\rho_w = \beta_0 A_T^{\beta_1}$
    - Second: $\rho_r = \rho_w * S_r = \gamma_0 A_T^{\gamma_1}$
        - where $S_r$ is the commute mode share, $\rho_r$ is the ridership
        - $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ reflects the returns to scale
    - Model fit: $R^2$ (best fits is at 45 minute threshold)

4. **Data Source: Open**
    - Job accessibility is defined as the number of jobs reachable by PT in a given travel time (Accessibility Observatory)
    - US Census Bureau
    - American Community Survey
    - Employer-Household Dynamics (OD)
5. **Findings:**
    - Both the total working population and the total transit commuters scales with transit accessibility to jobs
    - Transit commuters with lengthy commutes tend to have shorter commute times after residential location change
    - Both transit commuters and the working population can be predicted using transit accessibility to jobs
    - More accessible job oppotunites is associated with higher residential density
    - Transit rider density rises faster than population density with increasing transit accessibility
    - Efficiency through scale is more evident for transit rider densities than it is for the working population density
    - Auto-user density declines at high transit accessibility.
    - Larger cities have a greater transit ridership return on accessibility than smaller cities
    - Historical city size affects the scaling coefficients
    - Transit accessibility expansion induces further transit use and land-use intensification
    - Similar observation for inetrcity scaling
