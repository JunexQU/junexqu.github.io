### **Objective:**
- What factors explain the unprecendented concentration of knowledge and wealth in large cities?
- Why has the sptial concentration of activities increased in a world dominated by digital communications and international travel?

### **Case:**
- US, MSA and core-based statistics area

### **Methodology:**
- OLS
  
### **Data Source: Open**
- Population: Census
- Patent: USPTO, HisPat
- Papers: Elsevier
- GDP: Bureau of Economic Analysis
- Occupations: Bureau of labor statistics

### **Findings:**

- Activities to be highly concentrated (measured by research papers, patents, occupations and industries), especially in large cities
- Power law: $y=x^{\beta}$
