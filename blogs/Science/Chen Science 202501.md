## [Liangzhi Chen et al. ,Global increase in the occurrence and impact of multiyear droughts.Science](10.1126/science.ado4245)

### **Objective:**
- Map the global distribution of persistent multiyear drought (MYD) and characterize them by focusing not only on anomalies in the water balance but also the impacts on natural ecosystems

### **Case:**
- Global country

### **Methodology:**
- Index
- Regression

### **Data Source**
- Drought
- Temperature

### **Findings:**

- Identify 13,176 spatiotemporal continuums with distinctly negative anomalies in standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), representing an MYD event that lasts for at least 2 consecutive years

- From 1980 to 2018, MYDs grew in size and temperature anomalies in affected areas increased
