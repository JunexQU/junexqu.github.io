## [Soergel, B., Kriegler, E., Weindl, I. et al. A sustainable development pathway for climate action within the UN 2030 Agenda. Nat. Clim. Chang. 11, 656–664 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01098-3)

### **Objective:**
- Quantify the role of sustainable development pathway (SDP)

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- REMIND-MAgPIE model: 56 SDGs 
  - REMIND: regional model of investments and development
  - MAgPIE: model of agricultural production and its impact on the environment

### **Data Source**

- V-Dem: Country-Year-Data
- Uppsala Conflict Data program
- Population and human capital stocks: Wittgenstein centre

### **Findings:**

- Healthy and sustainable diets drastically reduce non-co2 GHG emissions
- Lower policy costs and a strong reduced pressure on land limit the impact on energy and food expenditures, helping the poor to meet their needs

- The marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are largest in low-latitude and costal regions
