## [O’Garra, T., Kuz, V., Deneault, A. et al. Early engagement and co-benefits strengthen cities’ climate commitments. Nat Cities 1, 315–324 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00052-6)

### **Objective:**
- How cities have responded to COVID-19 with regards to their climate actions and climate finance and the extent of their engagement in green recovery
- Which factors are associated with different responses to COVID-19

### **Case:**
- 793 cities (carbon disclosure project)

### **Methodology:**
- Multilevel regression: generalized structureal equation model with multinomial logit
  - $\chi^2$
### **Data Source: Open**
- CDP platform
- Air pollution (NO2), nightlight and population: ClimActor dataset
- Mortality: Our world in data
- Government response index: Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker
- National GDP: World bank and OECD

### **Findings:**

- More cities reported increased climate action compared to decreased climate action due to COVID
- The opposite is true for climate finance

- East Asia is the region with the highest proportion of cities reporting increased emphasis on climate action and increased climate finance
- West Asia and Southeast Asia and Oceania are the regions with the highest proportion of cities reporing decreased emphasis on climate action

- Cities are more likely to increase their climate actions and finance
- Cities belonging to international climate networks are 8.7% less likely to report decreased emphasis on climate change and 13.8% more likely to report no change in emphasis on climate action
- 42.6% (n=338) of cities report no green recovery policies
