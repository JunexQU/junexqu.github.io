## [Zhang, Z., Guan, D., Wang, R. et al. Embodied carbon emissions in the supply chains of multinational enterprises. Nat. Clim. Chang. 10, 1096–1101 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0879-9)

### **Objective:**
- Present a comprehensive study to trace carbon emissions embedied in the supply chains of global multinational enterprises (MNE)

### **Case:**
- Global

### **Methodology:**
- Input-output:
  - Leontief matrix

### **[Data Source](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IJ4DDI)**
- IO table: OECD
- FDI: OECD and US
- Carbon emission: IEA

### **Findings:**

- Carbon footprint accounts for 18.7% of gloabl emissions
- The first peak happens in 2008. After the financial crisis, carbon footprints of MNE increased again and reached secondary and highest peak in 2011

- The major contributor is the growth in the outputs of MNEs
- China is the largest hosting region in 2016, followed by EU and US
- The largest carbon transfer through investment is from Chinese Hong Kong to mainland

- The volume of the carbon footprints of MNEs invested by developed countries was greater than the volume of their territorial emissions induced by foreign-owned enterprises, with the opposite findings for developing countries
- Chinese mainland has the largest net negative balance of embedied emissions in supply chains of MNEs
