### **Objective:**
- Explore how the underlying model's explanatory power could be improved 

### **Case:**
- Global countries, MAF region

### **Methodology:**
- Energy intensity: $\frac{Y}{P} = \frac{Y}{E} \frac{E}{P}$

### **Data Source**

- Energy supply: IEA, UN
- GDP and population: Penn world table

### **Findings:**

- A tight correlation between GDP per capita and PE capita
- The fastest global labor productivity growth on record occured during 1950-73, known as the goldend age of capitalism

- A fleet of 350 million on-road EVs in the US could imply an annual electricity demand of up to 1730 terawatt hours TWh (41% of the annual national electricity generation)

- The volume of the carbon footprints of MNEs invested by developed countries was greater than the volume of their territorial emissions induced by foreign-owned enterprises, with the opposite findings for developing countries
- Chinese mainland has the largest net negative balance of embedied emissions in supply chains of MNEs
