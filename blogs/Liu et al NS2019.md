### **Objective:**
- Trace shipping emissions of 4482 vessel calls back to the US-China bilateral trade of 12346 sub categories

### **Case:**
- China and US

### **Methodology:**
- Shipping emission: shipping emission inventory model
- Air quality: GEOS-Chem chemical transport model

### **Data Source**
- Country-level trade: China custom statistics yearbook
- Shipping data: STSD and AIS
- Commodity: marine logistics information platform

### **Findings:**

- Sea transport is responsible for 99.1% of the US-China trade

- In 2016 trade between the US and China constituted 3.4% of the world's trade, and resulted in 2.5% of global shipping emission

- Shipping emissions embodied in China-US exports are 41-48% higher than US-China exports

- The mortality in China accounted for 64.4% of the total global deaths induced by shipping emissions in the US-China trade, while little impact was found in the United states because of the sparser population compared to China
- Maritime transport could increase the traditional trade-related emissions with an increment of 20% in the US-China bilateral trade
