### **Objective:**
- Pinpoint the vulnerable generations in terms of the age-adjusted value of statistical life (AVSL), and identify regions in Japan with high medical care burdens because of PM2.5 exposure from a subnational level

- Japan

### **Methodology:**
- GEMM

- Economic cost

### **Data Source**
- PM2.5
- Population
- GDP
- Life expectancy and survival probability

### **Findings:**

- Total PM2.5-attributable deaths showed a 1.3-fold increase from 2001 to 2019, nearly 95% of them occurred in individuals aged over 60 years
