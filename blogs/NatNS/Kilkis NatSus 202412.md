### **Objective:**
- Show the potential for two-way proactive influencing between cities and companies, focusing on GHG emission reductions

### **Case:**
- 1098 cities around world

### **Methodology:**
- Lorenz curve

### **Data Source**
- Urban area: UN, GHSL
- GHG
- Firm and climate target
- Water stress: Water risk atlas

### **Findings:**

- The net-zero targets could potentially reduce their total annual emissions by 4.99 GtCO2 if such targets are extended t cover consumption-based emissions

- The reduction potential could increase by as much as 67% if the cities and companies that already have targets bring their co-located counterparts on board to keep abreast of their ambitions
