### **Objective:**
- Whether electrifying Class 8 heavy-duty trucks will reduce the absolute and relative air-pollution-related health burdens in disadvantaged communities and across different racial-ethnic groups over time with an evolving electricity grid mix

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- GREEM model for energy-related emission

### **Data Source**
- Truck flow
- Grid electricity
- Diesel emission
- PM2.5

### **Findings:**

- Battery-electric trucks reduce the relative share of air-pollution-related health impacts borne by disadvantaged communities relative to conventional diesel trucks

- The relative disparity between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities increases steadily over time from 0.7% to 6.9%
