## [Marotzke, J., Semmann, D. & Milinski, M. The economic interaction between climate change mitigation, climate migration and poverty. Nat. Clim. Chang. 10, 518–525 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0783-3)

### **Objective:**
- How poverty induces migration from a poor to a rich country- with and without randomly occurring climate events in the poor country, under both overall richer and poorer harvest conditions - and how this affects the prevention of dangerous climate change

### **Case:**
- Germany

### **Methodology:**
- Regression

### **Data Source**
- Survey

### **Findings:**

- Migration instigated by poverty or by a climate extreme event cannot, in the long run, be prevented

- The willingness of rich participants to contribute to climate mitigation is largest right when the poor are hit by a climate extreme event, exacerbating their poverty
