### **Objective:**
- Develop a backcassting exercise to analyse the energy and resource implications for the US LDV fleet remaining within sectoral CO2 emissions budgets consistent 

### **Case:**
- US

### **Methodology:**
- SSPs: GCAM
  - LDV fleet: FLAME model

### **[Data Source](https://zenodo.org/records/3982990)**

- EVs and socioeconomic

### **Findings:**

- Current policy and electrification targets are insufficient to remain within a suitable US LDC CO2 emission budget consistent with a 2$^circ$C target
- Under BAU scenario, up to 351 million EVs need to be on the road in 2050 or up to 90% of the on-road LDV fleet to remain within a suitable CO2 emission budget

- A fleet of 350 million on-road EVs in the US could imply an annual electricity demand of up to 1730 terawatt hours TWh (41% of the annual national electricity generation)

- The volume of the carbon footprints of MNEs invested by developed countries was greater than the volume of their territorial emissions induced by foreign-owned enterprises, with the opposite findings for developing countries
- Chinese mainland has the largest net negative balance of embedied emissions in supply chains of MNEs
