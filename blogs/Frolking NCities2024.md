### **Objective:**
- Generate a more complete picture of upward and outward urban growth dynamics, here grouped broad categories of slow growth, outward growth, upward growth and up-and-out growth

### **Case:**
- Cities, China

### **Methodology:**

### **Data Source**

- Morphological urban areas
- WSF-evo BF data
- Building floor area: IEA

### **Findings:**

- Many large cities show a shift from rapid growth in built fraction (BF) combined with slow growth in urban microwave backscatter (PR) to dominance by rapid PR and slow BF growth rates

- Megacities predominantly display vertical growth to occur first in the urban core are and then spread outward

- Increasing or decreasing BF or PR growth rates from one decade to the next, that is, acceleration or deceleration in building growth rate

- Most of the fast-up-and-out grid cells in the 2000s and 2010s were in China
