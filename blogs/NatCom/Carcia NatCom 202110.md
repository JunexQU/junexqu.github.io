### **Objective:**
- Analyse the present and future economic damages due to reduced labour productivity caused by extreme heat in Europe

### **Case:**
- EU

### **Methodology:**
- Heat stress: Wet Bulb Globe Temperature
- Quantile mapping
- Heat exposure function for workability

### **Data Source**
- Heat events: ERA5-land
- Population: SEDAC
- GTAP

### **Findings:**

- Extreme hot spells in EU varied greatly in frequency, duration, extention and severity

- Heatwaves undermined the economic growth of EU in the range of 0.3% - 0.5% of EU GDP

- The most affected regions are those with eigher more heat prone environments or a more exposed economic structure, or a combination of the two
