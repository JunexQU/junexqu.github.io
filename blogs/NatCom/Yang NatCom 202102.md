## [Yang, J., Zhou, M., Ren, Z. et al. Projecting heat-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios in China. Nat Commun](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21305-1)

### **Objective:**
- Assess the excess mortality risk of future heat exposure by cause of death, region and individual characteristics

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- Temperature and mortality
- Heat-related mortality

### **Data Source**
- Mortaility, weather and socioeconomic
- Temperature: RCP and NWAI-WG
- SSP

### **Findings:**

- People living in southern, eastern, central and northern China, subjects with cardiorespiratory disease, females, the elderly, and the illiterate will suffer more adverse effect from future high temperature
