## [Wu, Y., Zhong, L. Decarbonizing urban residential communities with green hydrogen systems. Nat Cities](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44284-024-00178-7)

### **Objective:**
- Introduce a bottom-up energy model linking climate, human behaviour, community archetypes and energy system models, aiming to ensure cost-effective deployment pathways of community green hydrogen systems for highly diverse urban residential communities

### **Case:**
- USA and Canada

### **Methodology:**
- Bottom-up energy model (Climate-human model)

### **Data Source**
- Climate data
- Energy

### **Findings:**

- Climate and human uncertainties show a more uneven and significant effect on the energy demand side rather than on the energy production side

- Subdistricts located in the center layer generally featured the lowest average HUEs across China; with an increase in spatial distance to the city center
