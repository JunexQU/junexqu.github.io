### **Objective:**
- Deploy a coupled global hydrologic-economic model with basin-level hydrologic and economic resolution to compute the loss of economic surplus due to that scarcity in each basin

### **Case:**
- Global countries

### **Methodology:**
- GCAM
- Water-to-availability

### **Data Source**
- Water
- Economy

### **Findings:**

- With the effects of inter-basin trade, hydrologic basins may experience highly positive or highly negative economic impact due to water scarcity

- The market response to water scarcity within hydrologic basin usually amplifies the uncertainty in hydro-climatic projections
