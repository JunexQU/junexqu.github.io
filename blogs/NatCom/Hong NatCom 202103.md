### **Objective:**
- Focus on an integrated, socio-behavioral definition of community resilience across temporal and spatial scales, to withstand and rapidly recover from an extreme event

### **Case:**
- Theoretical case

### **Methodology:**
- Empirical activity curve
- Resilience matrix

### **Data Source**
- Mobile phone

### **Findings:**

- A decrease in regular community activity levels during the hurricane
