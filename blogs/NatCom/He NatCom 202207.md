### **Objective:**
- Downscale climate change scenarios to the local scale to quantify the potential influences of the interactions among climate change and potential urban adaptation strategies on future global warming

### **Case:**
- Grid and cities in China

### **Methodology:**
- Weather research and forecasting model (WRF)
- Workability, work loss

### **Data Source**
- SSP
- Heat

### **Findings:**

- Without adaptation, most of cities across mainland China will undergo significant heat increases by the 2050s
