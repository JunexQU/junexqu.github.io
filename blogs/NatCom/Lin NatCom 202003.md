### **Objective:**
- Provide insights on consumption-driven economic rather than investment-driven development

### **Case:**
- China

### **Methodology:**
- Srtructural decomposition analysis
- MRIO

### **Data Source**
- MRIO: GTAP

### **Findings:**

- Saving rates increase contributed 188.6 Mt to changes in global industrial CO2 emissions during 2007-12, accounting for 0.7% of total CO2 emissions in 2012

- Significant sectors include energy generation, resource extaction and manufacturing industries
- On the contraty, the increase of saving rates in China reduced carbon emissions in agricultural and service sectors

- Saving rate increase led to 168.6 Mt of industrial CO2 emission increments, also leadting increase in other countries
- Positive correlation between China's saving rate and CO2 emission

- A 15% decrease in the saving rate of Chinese region can reduce 323 Mt (1.2%) global carbon emission
