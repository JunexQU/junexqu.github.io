### **Objective:**
- Analyse the effectiveness of political and technical measures on climate change

### **Case:**
- Global

### **Methodology:**
- Top-down analysis
- Bottom-up scenarios
- AirClim model
- Monte-Carlo

### **Data Source**
- emission
- passenger-kilometres

### **Findings:**

- Advances in airline operating efficiency including changing the type of aircraft, the number of seats and load factor lead to a reduced increase of flown kilometres
